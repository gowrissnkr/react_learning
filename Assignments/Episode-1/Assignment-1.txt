** Difference between libraries and frameworks?

    Libraries : 
    --> Libraries are collections of pre-written functions or code snippets that provide specific functionality.
    -->  Control over the application's flow remains with the developer, and the library is often used as a tool to simplify and speed up specific tasks.

    Frameworks :
    --> Frameworks, on the other hand, provide a structured architecture and dictate the overall flow and organization of an application. Developers build their applications within the framework's predefined structure, and the framework itself controls the flow of the program.

    react.development.js : 
    --> This version of React is intended for development and debugging purposes. It includes additional warnings, error messages, and helpful development tools that aid developers in identifying and addressing issues in their code.

    react.production.js : 
    --> The production version of React is optimized for performance and is intended for use in production environments. It omits development-specific warnings, error messages, and debugging tools to reduce file size and improve runtime performance.

** What are async and differ?

    Async : 
    --> Use the async attribute when you have scripts that can run independently and don't need to maintain a specific order of execution.

    Differ :
